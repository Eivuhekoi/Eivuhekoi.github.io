## Introduction

Greetings, people!  
My name is Ikoinufe Eivuhekoi. World-builder, amateur coder, full-time university student, abandoner of hobbies, collector of useless information and posessor of too many unneccesary titles.  
Main programming languages include Python and occasionally Haskell with an even smaller dash of Rust.  
In my freetime I like advocating for Free Software (Free as in **FREEDOM** not price), and occasionally working on my worldbuilding project: A Shattered World.
